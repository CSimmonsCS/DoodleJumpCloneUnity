# DoodleJumpCloneUnity
This project uses C# and Unity to build a replica of the popular mobile game DoodleJump.  The user bounces on platforms to go higher and higher.  If the user falls off the platforms off screen, then game over!  The user controls the Doodler with the 'left' and 'right' arrow keys.  The platforms are randomly generated on each load so each play is different than the last! 

WITHIN THE DOODLE_JUMP FOLDER WITHIN THIS REPO IS A ZIP FOLDER THAT CONTAINS THE UNITY APPLICATION FOR THIS GAME
